# Malaria Molecular Surveillance Study Design workshop

## Motivation
Malaria molecular surveillance (MMS) has expanded dramatically in recent years. Advances in sequencing technologies now make it possible to generate large volumes of genomic data, capturing both drug resistance markers and extensive variation across the parasite genome. At the same time, studies are scaling up to include far greater numbers of samples collected from multiple sites across wide geographic areas.

This expansion raises important design questions. How many samples are sufficient to answer key epidemiological and evolutionary questions? How many sites should be included, and how should they be distributed in space? Addressing these questions is critical for designing studies that are both scientifically robust and logistically feasible, and for ensuring that future investments in molecular surveillance yield the greatest possible insight.

## Aims
This workshop addresses the critical need for training in study design and sample size calculation for researchers and practitioners working in MMS. Its aim is to equip participants with practical skills and knowledge they can apply to their own studies and share within their institutions. By hosting all lectures and interactive materials on a freely accessible website, the workshop also creates a lasting public resource that supports the wider research community and promotes deeper understanding of how genomic surveillance can inform malaria control and elimination efforts.

## Workshop format

The in-person workshops involve a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and group discussions. We cover several topics relevant to MMS study design, including:

- Estimating prevalence
- Margin of error analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Power and sample size calculation
- Cluster-based study designs

The materials ([lectures](lectures.qmd) and [tutorials](tutorials.qmd)) can be undertaken independently, and we have also hosted several in-person workshops (see [Events](events.qmd)).

## Materials
The workshop materials are in English, and were developed by the following authors:

- Bob Verity
- Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez
- Sequoia Leuba
- Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg
- Hillary Topazian

All materials are freely available under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit). This website is produced from an open source [Github repository](https://github.com/mrc-ide/MMS-SD_workshop).

## Acknowledgments and funding
Funding for material development and the in-person workshops was provided by the Gates Foundation.
