# Malaria Molecular Surveillance Study Design workshop

## Workshop format

Over the course of 1.5 days (see [Schedule](schedule.qmd)) we will have a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and group discussions. The workshop will be in English. We will cover several topics relevant to malaria molecular surveillance (MMS) study design, including:

- Statistical power
- Sample size calculation
- Estimating prevalence
- Measuring changes in prevalence
- Cluster-based study design and intra-cluster correlation
- Guest lectures from experts conducting MMS studies
