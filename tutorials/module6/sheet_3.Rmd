## Your role
As the budget officer on the team, your job is to help your team make informed decisions on costing and study design considerations, including: 

- Choosing (and potentially limiting) the number of regions or health facilities.
- Adjusting sample sizes, number of clusters, and timelines.
- Conducting cost calculations, for example: 
  - Total Fixed Costs = Number of HFs × (Fixed Cost per HF + Transport Cost per HF)
  - Total Variable Costs = Total Samples Enrolled × Variable Cost per Sample Enrollment Rate

Do your best job to stay within your budget!
